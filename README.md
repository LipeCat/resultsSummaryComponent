## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Media query for responsive
- XMLHttpRequest

### What I learned

I learned a little bit how to handle the XMLHttpRequest object and work the JSON file to load dynamic values.

```js
const http_request = new XMLHttpRequest();

http_request.onreadystatechange = function () {};
```

### Continued development

I'll continue working in CSS for a better or readable code and also in JavaScript for new methods and a code more efficiently.

### Useful resources

- [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/readystatechange_event) - This guided me in the handling of the XMLHttpRequest object.
- [Media Query (Burguer menu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrNebzIUrt4&pp=ygUQbWVudSBoYW1idXJndWVzYQ%3D%3D) - This is not a media query video but helped me to handle it.
